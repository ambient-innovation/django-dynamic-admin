Add simple interactions to the otherwise static django admin.

## Installation

- Install the package via pip:

    ```pip install django-dynamic-admin-forms```

    or via pipenv:

    ```pipenv install django-dynamic-admin-forms```
- Add the module to `INSTALLED_APPS`:
    ```python
    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...,
        'django_dynamic_admin_forms',
        'django.contrib.admin'
        ...
    )
    ```
    Ensure that the `dynamic_admin_forms` comes before the
    default `django.contrib.admin` in the list of installed apps,
    because otherwise the templates, which are overwritten by `dynamic_admin_forms`
    won't be found.
- Ensure that the `dynamic_admin_forms` templates are found via using `APP_DIRS` setting:
  ```python
  TEMPLATES = [
      {
          'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
          'APP_DIRS': True,
          ...
      },
  ]
  ```
- Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to include this apps Javascript code in your `settings.STATIC_ROOT` directory

## Usage
- Add the `django_dynamic_admin_forms.DynamicModelAdminMixin` to your admin classes
- Add the `django_dynamic_admin_forms.urls` to your urls
  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin
  from django.urls import path, include

  urlpatterns = [
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
    path("dynamic-admin-form/", include("django_dynamic_admin_forms.urls")),
  ]
  ```
- In addition to the standard `fields` declaration, specify a list of `dynamic_fields`
- For each dynamic field, add a method `get_dynamic_{field_name}_field` to the admin
  - Input: `data: Dict[str, Any]` - the cleaned form data
  - Output:
    - `queryset: Optional[Queryset]` - The values to select from
    - `value: Any` - The value, the field should have (must be compatible to the field type)
    - `hidden: Bool` - True, if field should be hidden

- A rather non-sensical example:
  ```python
  from django.contrib import admin

  from .models import MyModel
  from django_dynamic_admin_forms.admin import DynamicModelAdminMixin


  @admin.register(MyModel)
  class MyModelAdmin(DynamicModelAdminMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    fields = ("name", "city")
    dynamic_fields = ("city",)

    def get_dynamic_city_field(self, data):
      # automatically choose first city that matches first letter of name
      name = data.get("name")
      if not name:
        queryset = City.objects.all()
        value = data.get("city")
      else:
        queryset = City.objects.filter(name__startswith=name[0])
        value = queryset.first()
      hidden = not queryset.exists()
      return queryset, value, hidden
  ```


## How it works
Whenever a dynamic form changes, an event handler makes a request to a special endpoint, which returns new HTML to swap
into  the existing form. This new HTML is directly generated by `django.contrib.admin`, so we only have to set the
outerHTML of the correct HTML elements to update the form.

## Limitations
- does not work in conjunction with inlines
- does not validate that the selected value is really part of the original queryset
  - if anybody can modify your DOM, they could potentially inject invalid values
  - you have to write `Model.clean()` methods to guard against that
- only tested with Django 3.2

## Development

For local development, create a virtual environment
in the `testproj` folder:
```shell
$ cd testapp
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ cd ..
$ pip install -e .
```
Now the package should be available in your virtual environment
and any changes should be directly visible. Run the project as a Django server and navigate to the admin page.

Alternatively, copy the directory `dynamic_admin_forms`
into any normal django project, so that the python interpreter
finds the local version instead of the installed (old) version.

## Running E2E tests

To run end-to-end tests locally:
```shell
$ cd testapp
$ python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 &  # start server
$ python manage.py loaddata fixtures/fixtures-dev.json
$ cd ../e2e
$ yarn install  # or npm install (only needed first time)
$ yarn cypress  # or npm run cypress
```

## Contribute

### Setup package for development

- Create a Python virtualenv and activate it
- Install "pip-tools" with `pip install -U pip-tools`
- Compile the requirements with `pip-compile --extra dev, -o requirements.txt pyproject.toml --resolver=backtracking`
- Sync the dependencies with your virtualenv with `pip-sync`

### Add functionality

- Create a new branch for your feature
- Change the dependency in your requirements.txt to a local (editable) one that points to your local file system:
  `-e /Users/workspace/django-dynamic-admin-forms` or via pip  `pip install -e /Users/workspace/django-dynamic-admin-forms`
- Ensure the code passes the tests
- Create a pull request

### Run tests

- Run tests
  ````
  pytest --ds settings tests
  ````

- Check coverage
  ````
  coverage run -m pytest --ds settings tests
  coverage report -m
  ````

### Git hooks (via pre-commit)

We use pre-push hooks to ensure that only linted code reaches our remote repository and pipelines aren't triggered in
vain.

To enable the configured pre-push hooks, you need to [install](https://pre-commit.com/) pre-commit and run once:

    pre-commit install -t pre-push -t pre-commit --install-hooks

This will permanently install the git hooks for both, frontend and backend, in your local
[`.git/hooks`](./.git/hooks) folder.
The hooks are configured in the [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](templates/.pre-commit-config.yaml.tpl).

You can check whether hooks work as intended using the [run](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-run) command:

    pre-commit run [hook-id] [options]

Example: run single hook

    pre-commit run ruff --all-files --hook-stage push

Example: run all hooks of pre-push stage

    pre-commit run --all-files --hook-stage push

### Update documentation

- To build the documentation run: `sphinx-build docs/ docs/_build/html/`.
- Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` to see the documentation.

### Translation files

If you have added custom text, make sure to wrap it in `_()` where `_` is
gettext_lazy (`from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _`).

How to create translation file:

* Navigate to `django-dynamic-admin-forms`
* `python manage.py makemessages -l de`
* Have a look at the new/changed files within `django_dynamic_admin_forms/locale`

How to compile translation files:

* Navigate to `django-dynamic-admin-forms`
* `python manage.py compilemessages`
* Have a look at the new/changed files within `django_dynamic_admin_forms/locale`

### Publish to ReadTheDocs.io

- Fetch the latest changes in GitHub mirror and push them
- Trigger new build at ReadTheDocs.io (follow instructions in admin panel at RTD) if the GitHub webhook is not yet set
  up.

### Publish to PyPi

- Update documentation about new/changed functionality

- Update the `Changelog`

- Increment version in main `__init__.py`

- Create pull request / merge to master

- This project uses the flit package to publish to PyPI. Thus publishing should be as easy as running:
  ```
  flit publish
  ```

  To publish to TestPyPI use the following ensure that you have set up your .pypirc as
  shown [here](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upload.html#using-pypirc) and use the following command:

  ```
  flit publish --repository testpypi
  ```

### Maintenance

Please note that this package supports the [ambient-package-update](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/).
So you don't have to worry about the maintenance of this package. All important configuration and setup files are
being rendered by this updater. It works similar to well-known updaters like `pyupgrade` or `django-upgrade`.

To run an update, refer to the [documentation page](https://pypi.org/project/ambient-package-update/)
of the "ambient-package-update".
